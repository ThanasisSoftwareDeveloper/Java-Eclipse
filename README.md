# Java-Eclipse

Voting for the right island for a holiday. There are 20 people voting and each person votes only once. We believe that the candidate islands that these people are invited to vote for are Mykonos, Santorini and Rhodes...

Write a Java program consisting of a class named Holiday and will ask the user to vote for the island that he/she considers the best holiday destination by entering from the keyboard 1 for Mykonos, 2 for Santorini and 3 for Rhodes. It will then print on the screen "You voted for ...", where the name of the island voted for will appear in place of the silences (...) or the message "Your vote was not valid!" in case you enter
something other than 1, 2, 3.

After everyone has voted, the program will calculate how many votes each island got and the percentage (%) of the total valid votes, will show the island with the fewest votes and the best holiday destination, i.e. the
island with the most votes.
